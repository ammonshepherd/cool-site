Here's a post that I just made.

and here's another line


and let's see if jekyll build works

use subprocess.run instead of subprocess.call

can't find jekyll command, so did source ~/.profile in the terminal session running the python webook script.

ran jekyll build in the webhook.py location, not in the copy-of-cool-site location, so adding an os.chdir into the right location, then run jeykll build
